# ma3route-sdk

This branch holds the different versions of documentation for the different version of the SDK.

View the site at https://ma3route.github.io/node-sdk

## local deployment

You can also view this website locally. Simply:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ma3route/node-sdk.git
$ cd node-sdk
$ git checkout gh-pages
```

You can use any proper web server to serve these static files. I suggest [indexzero](https://github.com/indexzero)'s [simple http server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server). Simply:

```bash
$ npm install http-server -g
$ http-server .
```
